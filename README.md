# Uni-Dash: Restaurant Ordering Web Application (MERN Stack)

A full-featured restaurant ordering web application built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), developed in three agile sprints to deliver a complete end-to-end user experience, from registration to order fulfillment and review.

---

## Project Overview

This project simulates a multi-user restaurant ordering system with role-based functionalities for customers and staff. It offers dynamic menu browsing, order management, password recovery, and product reviews — all optimized for real-world restaurant workflows.

Developed with **agile methodology**, the project was delivered in **three sprints**, each consisting of user stories, subtasks, QA, and retrospectives.
